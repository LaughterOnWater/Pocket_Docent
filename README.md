*Pocket Docent*
I call this app "Pocket Docent". A docent is an official, vetted and trained volunteer who explains or teaches about exhibits in a zoo, museum or public garden setting. They also give general directions to offices, gift shops, restrooms and parking lots, etc. 

I think of this app as a digital docent â€” an app that can answer general questions visitors may have about our animals, zoo hours and the grounds. 

I prefer the term "Pocket Docent" because it's less sterile or clinical-sounding than "Digital Docent". While some may think there are plenty of apps out there for specific zoos or public gardens, there are not. This is something relatively new in the app arena. (Surprise!)
