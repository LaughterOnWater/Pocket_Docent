  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, bald eagles eat mostly  fish, but will also capture and eat birds, small mammals, and scavenge carrion  (especially in winter) that they may find.</li>
    <li>At Bear Hollow, they receive a  rotation of rats and whole fish.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Body is between 28 and 42 inches in  length.&nbsp; Adults weigh around 6 &ndash; 8 pounds  (females tend to be just a bit larger).&nbsp; Their  bones are so light because they are hollow, enabling them to fly.&nbsp; Wingspan is immense &ndash; up to eight feet from  wingtip to wingtip.</li>
    <li>Adults have a brilliant white head and  tail.&nbsp; Bright yellow eyes, beak and feet  contrast against a dark brown body.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, bald eagles often life up  to 25 or 30 years.</li>

    <li>Reach maturity at four or five years of  age &ndash; the white head and tail are then completely filled in.</li>
    <li>Breeding occurs in the winter, and one  to three eggs are laid shortly thereafter.&nbsp;  Both males and females will incubate the eggs.</li>
    <li>Not all of the chicks will survive to  fledging though.</li>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Tend to be monogamous.&nbsp; However, if the pair cannot produce offspring  or if one mate dies, they will look for a new partner.</li>
    <li>Courtship flight involves incredible  aerial acrobatics &ndash; dives, cartwheels, free falling, talon locking.</li>
    <li>Can often be seen in large groups,  numbering up to 100 individuals at a time.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Bald eagles were once an endangered  species due to the wide use of DDT a chemical used in agriculture which was not  fatal to adults but could cause them to be infertile and weakened the shells of  eggs such that they broke before the chick was ready to hatch.&nbsp; Thankfully, they have fully recovered since  the banning of DDT.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>They were officially reclassified from  &lsquo;Endangered&rsquo; to &lsquo;Threatened&rsquo; on July 12, 1995.&nbsp;  Officially removed from the Federal list of endangered and threatened  wildlife on June 28, 2007.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>However, they are still completely  protected since they are our national emblem and a bird of prey.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Nests are the largest of any North  American bird.&nbsp; They can be thirteen feet  deep, eight feet across and weigh well over a ton.</li>
    <li>Our nation&rsquo;s emblem almost wasn&rsquo;t  according to popular legend.&nbsp; Ben  Franklin wanted to nominate the wild turkey instead of the bald eagle.&nbsp; However, according to Wikipedia, there may  not be as much truth to this legend.&nbsp; </li>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that&nbsp;Benjamin Franklin&nbsp;ever publically supported the&nbsp;Wild Turkey, rather than the Bald  Eagle, as a symbol of the United States. The origin of this claim is a letter  Franklin wrote to his daughter in 1784 from Paris. However, this letter was a  criticism of the&nbsp;Society of the  Cincinnati&nbsp;in which he stated his  personal distaste for the Bald Eagle's behavior but he does not mention  publically disputing the choice of the Bald Eagle for the&nbsp;Great Seal of the United States. In  the letter Franklin states: &lsquo;<em>For my own part. I wish the Bald Eagle had not been chosen the  Representative of our Country. He is a Bird of bad moral Character. He does not  get his Living honestly...Besides he is a rank Coward: The little&nbsp;King Bird&nbsp;not bigger than a Sparrow attacks him  boldly and drives him out of the District.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bald eagles are considered sacred by  many Native American tribes.&nbsp; Eagles are considered spiritual messengers  between gods and humans by some cultures.&nbsp;  A lone Eagle feather is thought to convey great power.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Female: Amazon (larger):<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>It&rsquo;s estimated that she hatched in the  wild around 1982.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <li>She was found with a wing injury in  1987.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <li>Rehabilitated at the Raptor Center at  Auburn University.&nbsp; She had a partial  right wing amputation because of a collision, most likely from a power line.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <li>Arrived at Bear Hollow on October 7,  2002.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Male: Hanovi <strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Hanovi allegedly translates to &ldquo;Strong&rdquo;.&nbsp; In researching it, I first found on a website  that Hanovi meant &ldquo;Deer&rdquo; in an unspecified Native American language.&nbsp; Ultimately, I discovered that Hanovi was the  pseudonym of a famous Native American fiction author, but I did find a  reference that Hanovi (alternately spelled Honovi) means &ldquo;Strong Deer&rdquo; in the  Hopi language. <strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <li>He was born in the wild and came to the  zoo after being rehabilitated in the summer of 2012. Estimates are that he  might have been born around 2005.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
