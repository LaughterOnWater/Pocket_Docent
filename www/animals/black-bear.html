<h2>Black Bears in Athens</h2>
<p>We're not likely to see a Black Bear in Athens, though in the very north-east tip of Georgia, you may ocassionally find them coming into mountain towns when food and water are scarce in the forest. You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, bears eat herbs, nuts, grasses,  berries, insects and their larvae, and a little animal matter. Occasionally  preys on small animals, rarely deer and livestock.</li>
    <li>At Bear Hollow, they receive a mix of  fruits and vegetables, dog chow, and peanut butter.</li>
    <li>Occasionally, you&rsquo;ll see an  enrichment object in their exhibit (like a large PVC pipe with food items  inside, or a cardboard box, a pumpkin or food items stuffed in the big  tires).&nbsp; These enrichment objects are  designed to give them a challen<a name="_GoBack"></a>ge, something new, and to  force them to forage for their food in a way that simulates their time in the  wild.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Wooded areas primarily.&nbsp; Also live in mountains, swamps and coastal  areas. </li>
    <li>In North America, occurs in 41 of 50  states.</li>
    <li>In Georgia, distribution is patchy.&nbsp; Most populations are in the mountain and  coastal plain regions, but occasional wandering into the piedmont is not  uncommon.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Thick black fur covers the body.&nbsp; Snout is generally brownish.&nbsp; Short, rounded ears. </li>
    <li>Can be five to six feet in length, and  2.5 to three feet tall at the shoulder.</li>
    <li>Females weight between 90 and 400  lbs.&nbsp; Males weigh between 250 and 600  lbs. </li>
    <li>Hind legs are slightly longer than fore  legs.&nbsp; Has 42 teeth.</li>
    <li>They usually walk with a shuffling gait,  but can run at speeds of over 30 mph.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>They are agile climbers.&nbsp; Look at the trees in the bear exhibit.&nbsp; Branches that are broken or pointing downward  indicate where the bears have climbed.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Dexterous toes and lips and a long  tongue enable American black bears to gather berries and insects they dig up  after ripping open rotting logs or honey combs with their strong, curved claws. </li>

  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Black bears can live anywhere from 21-34  years.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>In the wild, America black bears can  live up to 32 years.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a></li>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Reach breeding maturity at 3 or 4 years  of age.&nbsp; However, males may not be strong  enough to win breeding rights for several more years.</li>
    <li>Mating generally occurs from June to  August, and the two or three cubs are born in January or February the following  year.</li>
    <li>Cubs become independent their second  summer.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Black bear activity periods shift during  the year, but they are mostly diurnal.</li>
    <li>Generally timid and prefer to flee than  to have a confrontation.&nbsp; Black bears  seldom attack, expect when they are injured, or feel cornered or threatened.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Black bears are a species of least  concern.&nbsp; In fact, most populations in  the eastern US seem to be increasing steadily.</li>
    <li>Only the isolated Louisiana, Texas and  Mississippi populations are listed as threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service. However, other unlisted but scattered populations, such as those in  Florida, are vulnerable to poaching, habitat loss, and roadkill deaths.&nbsp; Some estimates put the continent&rsquo;s black bear  population at about a half million.</li>
    <li><img width="140" height="215" src="../assets/images/black-bear-trained.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Harry_Colebourne_and_Winnie.jpg/220px-Harry_Colebourne_and_Winnie.jpg">While black bears themselves are  not currently endangered, there are serious concerns because of the large  demand in Asian markets both in the US and abroad for bear bile, bile taken  from bear gallbladders purported to have medicinal qualities.&nbsp; Overharvesting of bears for their  gallbladders has decimated bear populations in Asia, particularly the Asiatic  Black Bear.&nbsp; There are growing concerns  of the legal and illegal harvesting of American Black Bears to meet the demand  in Asian markets.&nbsp; Thankfully,  conservation efforts in the United States are working to ensure that American  Black Bears do not follow the course of the rest of the world&rsquo;s bears where six  of the total eight bear species are threatened with extinction.</li>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Smokey the Bear is based off of an  actual black bear cub found in New Mexico after a forest fire. </li>
    <li>Morris Michtom, the creator of the&nbsp;teddy bear, was inspired to make the toy when he came across a  cartoon of&nbsp;Theodore  Roosevelt&nbsp;refusing to shoot a black bear cub trapped up a tree. &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Winnie the Pooh&nbsp;was named  after&nbsp;Winnipeg, a female black bear cub that lived at&nbsp;London Zoo&nbsp;from 1915 until her death in 1934. (Pictured right).&nbsp;  Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after&nbsp;Winnie, a Canadian&nbsp;black  bear&nbsp;which he often saw at&nbsp;London  Zoo, and &quot;Pooh&quot;, a swan they had met while  on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian  Lieutenant&nbsp;Harry Colebourn&nbsp;in&nbsp;White  River, Ontario, Canada, while en route to England  during the First World War. He named the bear &quot;Winnie&quot; after his  adopted hometown in&nbsp;Winnipeg, Manitoba. &quot;Winnie&quot; was surreptitiously brought  to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as&nbsp;The Fort Garry Horse&nbsp;regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo  while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to  the zoo, as she had become a much loved attraction there </li>
    <li>Male bears (bruins) tend to wander far  and wide.&nbsp; Females (sows) tend to remain  close to the area in which they were born.</li>
    <li>Each paw has five long claws.&nbsp; They are used to tear through logs for food  and help the bear climb trees.&nbsp; You can  direct guests to look at the trees in the bear yard.&nbsp; All of the tree limbs that are  pointing/angled downwards are that way because of bears climbing them!&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Some guests will ask you if DJ and one  of the females might reproduce.&nbsp; All of  the bears are spayed/neutered so that they cannot reproduce.&nbsp; We are not a breeding facility and breeding  animals would not serve our mission.&nbsp; </li>

    <ul>
      <li>Born wild in January 2003, but raised at  Ellijay Wildlife Rehabilitation Sanctuary.&nbsp;  He was probably orphaned  when he was about two months old.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <li>Arrived  at Bear Hollow in late Sept. 2006.&nbsp; He is still growing but currently is about 6 ft. tall  and weighs nearly 400 lbs.<strong><u></u></strong></li>

      <li>Sisters born in the Spring of 2010.&nbsp; <strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <li>Athena has a white patch on her chest  and Yonah does not.&nbsp; It is roughly  crescent moon shaped and is a coloration that occurs in only 25% of American  Black Bears; however, it is constant in Asiatic Black Bears.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a> The Asiatic black bear is the American black bear's  closest cousin. Both are thought to have evolved from a common European  ancestor.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a><strong><u></u></strong></li>

      <li>Josie &ndash; Female bear born in captivity in 1988.&nbsp; She was donated to Bear Hollow by the Humane  Society of Cleveland, Ohio in 1990.&nbsp; DJ&rsquo;s former cagemate passed away in early summer of  2010 due to a degenerative spinal condition. She was 22 years old.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
