<h3>Diet<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>Young hatchlings tend to feed on lizards and tree frogs, while adults  feed on larger prey, such as mice, rats, birds, and bats. </em></li>
  <li><em>At Bear Hollow, they are fed mice, rats, and chicks.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3><img width="168" height="168" src="../assets/images/corn-snake-range-map.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="http://www.woodlandparkzoo.org/view.image?Id=2058">Range  and Habitat<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Corn snakes are found in the eastern  United States from southern New Jersey south through Florida, west into  Louisiana and parts of Kentucky. However, corn snakes are most abundant in  Florida and the southeastern U.S.</li>
  <li>Corn snakes may be found in wooded  groves, rocky hillsides, meadowlands, woodlots, barns, and abandoned buildings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Physical Features<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>Corn snakes are  slender with a length of 24 to 72 inches. They are usually orange or brownish  yellow, with large, black-edged red blotches down the middle of the back. </em></li>
  <li><em>Considerable variation  occurs in the coloration and patterns of individual snakes, depending on the  age of the snake and the region of the country in which it is found. Hatchlings  lack much of the bright coloration found on adults.</em><strong><u> </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Life Span<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>The life span of  this snake is up to 23 years in captivity but is generally much less in the  wild.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Reproduction<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>T<em>he breeding season of corn snakes is from March to  May. The snakes are oviparous, meaning they produce eggs that mature and hatch  after being expelled, depositing a clutch of ten to 30 eggs in late May to  July. Eggs are laid in rotting stumps, piles of decaying vegetation, or other  similar locations where there is sufficient heat and humidity to incubate them.  The adult snakes do not care for the eggs. </em></li>
  <li><em>Once laid, the  gestation period of the eggs is 60 to 65 days at about 82&deg; F. The eggs hatch  sometime in July through September. Hatchlings are 10 to 15 inches long and  mature in 18 to 36 months.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Behavior<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>These snakes are generally solitary in  the wild, but in captivity they can be housed with snakes of similar size and  habits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conservation<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>Corn snakes for  the most part are locally abundant.&nbsp;  However, they are listed by several states because they face habitat  loss and destruction. </em></li>
  <li><em>Corn snakes are  often mistaken for copperheads and killed.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpretive Information<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The name corn snake is believed to have  originated from the similarity of the markings on the belly to the checkered  pattern of kernels of maize or Indian corn.</li>
  <li>They are also sometimes called the red rat  snake.</li>
  <li><em>Corn  snakes are primarily diurnal (active during the day). They readily climb trees  and enter abandoned buildings in search of prey. However, they are very  secretive and spend most of their time underground prowling through rodent  burrows. They also often hide under loose bark and  beneath logs, rocks, and other debris during the day.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Bear Hollow&rsquo;s Corn Snakes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Female: Niblett<strong><u></u></strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>She was captive bred and hatched in May  of 1996. <strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>She has been at barn hollow since she  was 8 weeks old.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>She is on exhibit along with the  Southern Pine Snake.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Male: &nbsp;Creamsicle<strong><u></u></strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Albino Corn Snake &ndash; he came from the pet  trade and has a gaping problem due to stress.&nbsp;  This does not interfere with his use as a program animal, just be aware  that if he&rsquo;s holding his mouth open &ndash; that is why.&nbsp; He is an off-exhibit program animal (lives above  &nbsp;Bandit, the grey rat snake).<strong><u></u></strong></li>
