<h2>Eastern Screech Owl</h2>
<p>Masters of camouflage, these feathered friends come in red and gray forms or &quot;morphs&quot;. When  perfectly still against the right tree bark, they can be almost impossible to see.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, Eastern Screech-Owls eat most kinds of  small animals, including birds and mammals as well as surprisingly large  numbers of invertebrates, including earthworms, insects, crayfish, tadpoles,  frogs, and lizards.</li>
    <li>At Bear Hollow, the Eastern Screech-Owls  eat a ration of rats, and baby chicks.</li>
  </ul>
  <div></div>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Range and  Habitat</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Range" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Eastern Screech-Owls are found  throughout East North America from  East Montana and the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, South to Tamaulipas in  Northeast Mexico; also South Ontario to Florida.</li>
    <li>In Georgia,  screech owls are found statewide.</li>
    <li>They do not  have a preferred habitat type, but are generalists. They can be found in open  hardwood, pine and northern coniferous forest, swamps, mountains and in  suburban areas like back yards and parks. Almost any habitat with sufficient tree cover will do  for this cosmopolitan owl. </li>
    <li>Tree cavities or nest boxes are essential, and fairly open  understories are preferred, but Eastern Screech-Owls live and breed  successfully in farmland, suburban landscapes, and city parks.</li>
</ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>The Eastern Screech-Owl is a short, stocky bird, with a large  head and almost no neck. Its body length is between 6 - 10 inches, and its  weight is about the weight of a hamburger patty.</li>
    <li>Their wings are rounded, and their wingspan is<strong> </strong>between 19 -  24 inches.</li>
    <li>Their tail is short and square and their pointed ear tufts  are often raised, lending its head a distinctive silhouette. </li>
    <li>Eastern Screech-Owls can be either mostly gray or mostly  reddish-brown (rufous). Whatever the overall color, they are patterned with  complex bands and spots that give the bird excellent camouflage against tree  bark. </li>
    <li>Their eyes are yellow, and they have short legs, usually  hidden under their feathers.</li>
    <li>They also have 2 small tufts of feathers on top of their  head.  These are not ears though people  often think that they are.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>While captive Eastern Screech Owls have lived for over 20  years, wild birds would be unlikely to reach this age.  Juvenile and adult mortality may be as high as  70% and 30% respectively. </li>
    <li>Predators of these Owls include Great Horned Owls, Barred  Owls, Long-eared Owls, Great gray Owls, Short-eared Owls, Snowy Owls, mink,  weasels, raccoons, skunks, snakes, crows, and Blue Jays.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>The average age for sexual maturity for  both male and female screech owls is one year.</li>
    <li>Breading season for Eastern Screech Owls  is generally around mid April, but may range from mid March to mid May.</li>
    <li>Nests are usually found in natural tree  cavities, hollow stumps, and limbs; nests have been found up to 50 feet above  the ground. Remnant materials are formed into a depression, instead of building  a nest in the cavity. They also use nest boxes.</li>
    <li>The clutch size is usually 3-5 white to off-white  eggs, with an incubation period of 26-30 days. </li>
    <li>Usually having 1  brood a year, the eastern screech owl may have a second brood if the first is  lost. </li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Screech Owls are primarily solitary,  with each individual having its own staked out territory. They may congregate  to inspect a newcomer or when breeding season begins.</li>
    <li>Most owl pairs, of about the same age,  will bond for life. Male screech owls execute elaborate courtship displays. To  advertise a nest site he will trill, hop, bow, bill snap and fill the nest with  food. A female will usually choose a nest site that has been well supplied by  the male. They will nest together during mating season and throughout the  winter. Individuals will replace a mate that has disappeared.</li>
    <li>At the end of the breeding season, the  parents force the young out of their birth territory. Little is known about when  this is done, but it appears to be affected by weather, food availability, and  population density.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Screech Owls are of little conservation concern. They seem to  be very common across their range, and are often found in  backyards in suburban areas.</li>
    <li>Like other birds of prey, they are completely  protected by both state and federal laws. </li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Screech owls do not hoot, they have a whinny-like call. There  are several variations: some ascend in pitch, others descend, and others do not  waver (this is called a &lsquo;tremolo&rsquo;).</li>
    <li>The true function of the two tufts of feathers on their head  is unknown, but it is speculated that they help break up the outline of the owl  when it is resting.</li>
    <li>When prey is plentiful, Eastern Screech-Owls cache extra food  in tree holes for as long as four days.</li>
  </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Female: Calypso<strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>She was most likely hit by a car and  lost an eye, making her non-releasable.   She was found by the road by some truckers in Wyoming. While she might  be able to survive on her own, her disability would severely limit her ability  to hunt and would cause her to be marginalized by healthy screech owls, leading  her to have trouble surviving in the wild and likely starving.  <strong><u></u></strong></li>
        <li>She was  successfully rehabilitated and came to the zoo from the UGA Vet School in April  of 2011.  Prior to coming to the UGA Vet  School, she&rsquo;d been at AWARE (Atlanta Wild Animal Rescue Effort) since March 9,  2011.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
        <li>She is fully flighted  and fairly skittish around people.  If  you are having trouble catching her, be sure to stop if she appears to be getting  too stressed, for instance if she&rsquo;s breathing heavily.<strong><u> </u></strong></li>

      <li>Male:   Radar <em>(pictured above)</em><strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Radar is imprinted on humans after being  hand raised.  He came with Clint when he  transferred here from Cheehaw Park in Albany, Georgia.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
        <li>Grey phase (pictured above)<strong><u></u></strong></li>
        <li>Radar died in November of 2012.  The cause of death is unknown as no autopsy  could be performed.  Any visitors who ask  about him, as he was a favorite, should be informed that he lived a good, long  life and recently passed away from unknown, but presumably natural, causes.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
        <li>Passed November 2012 – unknown cause and  necropsy unable to be performed<strong><u></u></strong></li>
