<h2>Gopher Frogs in Athens</h2>
<p>They don't normally live this far north, so you're not likely to see them in the wilds of Athens, GA. However they are a native species of southern Georgia and live in the burrows of Gopher Tortoises. You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, adult gopher frogs feed on  invertebrates, as well as on other anurans, especially toads.</li>
    <li>At Bear Hollow, the frogs eat crickets. </li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Range and  Habitat</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Range" --> <img width="265" height="348" src="/Pocket_Docent/assets/images/gopher-frog-range-map.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="range map: eastern US">
  <ul>
    <li>They are  mainly found on the Coastal Plain of the Southeastern United States. </li>
    <li>The  gopher frog usually spends daylight hours in burrows, holes, or tunnels that  are created by other animals.&nbsp;In  sandhill habitats, they frequently seek refuge in gopher tortoise burrows.</li>
    <li>In Georgia, the gopher frog is  restricted to longleaf pine ecosystems. It occurs in sandy and well drained,  longleaf pine - saw palmetto - wiregrass sandhills as well as more poorly  drained longleaf pine flatwoods.&nbsp; Gophers  are a resident in the sandhills, particularly of the longleaf pine-wiregrass  ecosystem.</li>
    <li>They need open areas with sandy soil and  lots of grasses and other vegetation to forage.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>The gopher frog is a stout, medium-sized  frog with adults ranging from 6.5 - 10.8 cm (2&frac12; - 4&frac14; inches) in length. </li>
    <li>Dorsal coloration is variable and may be  brown, gray, or creamy white with numerous reddish brown or dark brown spots.  Warts are prominent on the dorsum. Two raised ridges (dorsolateral folds),  often tinged with a yellow or brassy color, run down the back, one reaching  from behind each eye to the hind limb. These raised ridges are one of the key  identifiers.</li>
    <li>The belly is white or cream-colored with  dark mottling in most Georgia populations. There is often yellow on the underside  of the hind limbs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Life expectancy ranges from six to ten years.</li>
    <li>Males are mature at four to six months. Females mature in two to three years.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In Georgia, the gopher frog is  restricted to longleaf pine ecosystems. It occurs in sandy and  well drained, longleaf pine - saw palmetto - wiregrass sandhills as well as  more poorly <br>
      drained  longleaf pine flatwoods.</li>
    <li>The wetlands used by breeding gopher  frogs are typically ephemeral (seasonally dry) and always lack larger,  predatory fish species.</li>
    <li>Gopher frogs typically migrate to  breeding ponds in the fall, winter, and early spring in association with heavy  rains. Adults spend a variable period of time at the breeding pond; males  typically remain at ponds longer than females. Adult male frogs call from  shallow water along the shoreline, while floating on the surface of the water  in deep areas, or while submerged. The call is of very low frequency and can  carry a considerable distance. Females attach large egg masses (up to the size  of a grapefruit) to emergent vegetation near the water&rsquo;s surface. Egg masses  may contain 2,000 or more individual eggs. Average length of time to hatching  is approximately a week. Metamorphosis follows an 87-215 day developmental  period.</li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Gopher frogs are extremely secretive so  little appears to be known about their social behavior beyond their breeding  habits and the fact that they live in gopher tortoise burrows or abandoned  mammal burrows.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Largely due to the drastic loss of this  ecosystem, as well as to the embedded isolated wetlands necessary for breeding  and larval development, gopher frog populations have significantly declined  throughout their range. Listed as &quot;rare&quot; in Georgia, extant  populations in the state are known from only six sites. Because of the highly  fragmented landscape throughout the gopher frog's historic range, it is very  unlikely that the species will recolonize restored lands without the help of  repatriation efforts. It is likely that the decline of gopher tortoise populations  has adversely affected this frog.</li>
    <li>The Atlanta Botanical Garden, in  partnership with the University of Georgia, Georgia Department of Natural  Resources, the Nature Conservancy, Jones Ecological Research Center, and Zoo  Atlanta, collects portions of wild Gopher Frog egg masses so that they can be  reared in captivity. The resulting tadpoles are safely grown in Atlanta  Botanical Garden facilities until they metamorphose into froglets. At this  point they are transported to a Nature Conservancy preserve in southwestern  Georgia that has all of the right environmental conditions, but no Gopher  Frogs. These released frogs have also been marked with a special acrylic  elastomer, basically a frog tattoo, so that if they are recaptured in the  future, biologists will know when they were released.</li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>While they are not federally protected,  they are considered &ldquo;Rare&rdquo; in Georgia and various protected populations exist.</li>
    <li>This is a perfect animal to talk about  in conjunction with the Gopher Tortoise as this is one of the many species that  relies on the Gopher Tortoise for its own existence.</li>

  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Animal Roster" -->
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;UGA  and the State Botanical Gardens were doing a conservation project where they  would go to some place east of Macon and they collected egg masses out of the  wild.&nbsp; They divided them up between  approximately four different facilities and ours was one of them.&nbsp; Bear Hollow staff fostered them and then  returned them to UGA when they were a certain age and then UGA released them to  certain sites in the wild.&nbsp; Ours was the  one that produced the most, in large part due to Tom&rsquo;s careful husbandry of  them.&nbsp; Ask Tom if you have any questions  about them!<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>A video documentary about this was  created by Georgia Outdoors and is likely viewable online.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
