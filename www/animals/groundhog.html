<h2>Groundhogs in Athens</h2>
<p>These creatures live less in town and more in the surrounding county. It's entirely possible you've caught sight of a Groundhog in the Athens area. You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>The groundhog is  an herbivore eating almost any type of vegetation that they can find from  grasses and plants to fruits and vegetables and even tree bark.&nbsp; They can decimate vegetable gardens much to  the dismay of local gardeners.</li>
    <li>In the wild they  live a feast-or-famine lifestyle, gorging themselves in the warmer months to  prepare for winter hibernation. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>They will  occasionally eat insects, eggs, and young birds, and will eat bean, peas,  carrot tops, alfalfa and soybeans, if available.&nbsp;An adult woodchuck can  consume over a pound of vegetation each day.</li>
    <li>Groundhogs  hydrate through eating leafy plants rather than drinking from a water source.</li>
    <li>At  Bear Hollow, they receive a mix of fruits and vegetables except during winter  hibernation.</li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Range and  Habitat</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Range" --> <img width="162" height="122" src="../assets/images/groundhog-range-map.gif" align="right" hspace="12" alt="range map: eastern US">
  <ul>
    <li>Groundhogs can be  found in approximately half of the North American continent (see map).</li>
    <li>Woodchucks are  found statewide in a variety of habitats. They prefer meadows, pastures, crop  fields, and yards that are close to a woody edge. They are common in brushy or  weedy areas along fence rose or road right-of-ways.</li>
    <li>They&nbsp;prefer elevations at  or below 2000 meters and require areas with dry soils. Important habitat  features include a plethora of shelters to choose from (they usually change  their resting site each day); suitable features include matted grass, leaf litter,  rocky crevices, termite mounds or previously-dug burrows. They tend to prefer  grassy areas with light undergrowth.</li>
    <li>Groundhog  burrows usually have two to five entrances, providing groundhogs their primary  means of escape from predators. Burrows are particularly large, with up to 14 metres  (46&nbsp;ft) of tunnels buried up to 1.5 metres (5&nbsp;ft) underground, and  can pose a serious threat to agricultural and residential development by  damaging farm machinery and even undermining building foundations. </li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>They normally weigh around 13-14lbs, which is about the size  of an average housecat. </li>
    <li>They  are normally 25 inches long, including the tail.</li>
    <li>Groundhogs are covered with two coats of fur: a dense grey  undercoat and a longer coat of banded&nbsp;guard  hairs&nbsp;that gives the groundhog  its distinctive &quot;frosted&quot; appearance.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, groundhogs can live up to six years, with two or  three being average. <strong><u> </u></strong></li>
    <li>In captivity, groundhogs are reported to live from 9&ndash;14  years. <strong><u> </u></strong></li>
    <li>Common predators for groundhogs include&nbsp;wolves,&nbsp;coyotes,&nbsp;foxes,&nbsp;bobcats,&nbsp;bears, large&nbsp;hawks, and dogs. <strong><u> </u></strong></li>
    <li>Young groundhogs are often at risk for predation by snakes,  which easily enter the burrow.<strong><u> </u></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Woodchucks  breed in late February or March and usually not until the animal is close to 2  years old. Four to five young are born in April or May.&nbsp;A woodchuck will  give birth to only one litter per year. <strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>The  young will start to find their own territory when they are just a few months  old.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Woodchucks are  territorial, except during the breeding season, and will defend their burrows  against intruders. They will make noise with their incisors and use short,  sharp whistles to warn other woodchucks of danger. They are not fast runners,  but will defend themselves when threatened without a way to escape.</li>
    <li>They are  generally diurnal.</li>
    <li>Though  groundhogs are the most solitary of the marmots, several individuals may occupy  the same burrow. </li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>They  are a species of least concern. Some states have designated hunting seasons  for them.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>After the first  frost, they retreat to their underground burrows and snooze until spring,  drawing their sustenance from body fat. While hibernating, the animal's heart  rate plunges, and its body temperature is not much warmer than the temperature  inside its burrow.</li>
    <li>Groundhog  hibernation gave rise to the popular American custom of Groundhog Day, held on  the second of February every year. Tradition dictates that if a groundhog sees  its shadow that day, there will be six more weeks of winter</li>
    <li>Groundhogs  are the largest members of the squirrel family. </li>
    <li>Though  they are usually seen on the ground, they can climb trees and are also capable  swimmers. </li>
    <li>These  rodents frequent the areas where woodlands meet open spaces, like fields,  roads, or streams. </li>

  <ul>
    <li>Male &ndash; Gus </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Gus a male woodchuck arrived in June  2007. He was born in captivity on April 12, 2007. </li>
      <li>He initially was kept in the window  of the Exhibit Hall, and then he was housed for years in the exhibit that Hooch  and Victor the Vulture now share.&nbsp; We  hope his new exhibit will be on the top of the hill next to the big entrance  that is currently closed off. </li>
      <li>Gus is currently off-exhibit while a  new enclosure for him is constructed.&nbsp; We  plan to begin a big push to raise funds for his new exhibit called &ldquo;Gus&rsquo; <em>Green</em> House&rdquo; because we hope to raise  money for it and build it in an environmentally friendly way.&nbsp; We hope to have a can drive soon.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Docents should remain aware of Gus  even though he&rsquo;s off-exhibit and be able to talk to guests about him as many  people ask where he is or how they can help! </li>
