<h3>Diet:<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The hedgehog is an insectivore and primarily eats insects  (termites, beetles) and other arthropods (spiders, scorpions, millipedes). They  do consume a variety of other foods as well, including invertebrates (snails,  earthworms, slugs, land crabs) small vertebrates (snakes, lizards, frogs, young  birds, and eggs) and plant material (roots, fruits, fungi). Some have even been  observed consuming venomous snakes!</li>
  <li>At  Bear Hollow, they receive a mix cat food, baby food, fresh fruits and  vegetables, crickets, meal worms, and roaches.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Hedgehogs can be found on the continents of Africa, Asia,  and Europe.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>They occupy a variety of habitats including grasslands,  woodlands, bush, thickets, plains, agricultural land, and even suburban gardens  (they have also been encountered in stables and food storage buildings in  suburban areas and areas drawn to livestock, which attract insects).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>They&nbsp;prefer elevations at or below 2000 meters and  require areas with dry soils. Important habitat features include a plethora of  shelters to choose from (they usually change their resting site each day);  suitable features include matted grass, leaf litter, rocky crevices, termite  mounds or previously-dug burrows. They tend to prefer grassy areas with light  undergrowth</li>
</ul>
<h3>Physical Features:<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Small,  about the size of a guinea pig. Can be 7-9 inches long, and weigh 1-2 pounds</li>
  <li>Long  pointy snout, large eyes, 4 digits on each foot. </li>
  <li>Soft  white to dark brown fur covering their face and under parts &amp; tiny,  non-barbed spines cover the rest. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Life Span:<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hedgehogs  live from 4-6 years in the wild and up to 10 years in captivity</li>
  <li>Predators of the hedgehog are  Carnivores, and some large birds. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Reproduction:<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some species of hedgehogs  have no apparent mating season and breed throughout the year. They become  sexually mature at approximately one year of age. </li>
  <li>Gestation lasts 30-40 days  and litters range in size from 2-10 young with females typically having one  litter per year. Neonates (babies) are born blind and naked; white spines  emerge after 2-3 days. Between 8-18 days, the eyes will open and the white,  infant spines are shed and replaced with spines of the adult coloration. At 40  days the young will accompany the mother on foraging trips and will eat  increasing amounts of solid foods until they are completely weaned. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Behavior:<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The hedgehog is solitary, and only comes together with  animals of the same species during the breeding season. These animals are  territorial and will engage in aggressive behavior if their territory is  encroached upon. In a territorial attack, the animal will erect the spines  around its head and snort, grunt, hiss, and butt heads with the offending  individual. Spines are also used as a defensive mechanism when evading  predators; the hedgehog's first line of defense is to roll up into a ball, in  doing so, the spines erect at opposing angles forming a protective barrier  around the animal.&nbsp;Hedgehogs&nbsp;have been known to attack predators by  erecting its spines and lunging at its attacker.</li>
  <li>Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal, but can be crepuscular  (active at dawn and dusk). During extreme weather conditions, they will  aestivate- a form of summer hibernation initiated by extreme heat whereby they  will go into hiding, lower their metabolic rate, and subsist off of fat  reserves until environmental conditions improve.</li>
  <li>Vocalizations include a repertoire of snorts, hisses, grunts,  and twitters. During courtship, males serenade females with a birdlike call and  she will respond with hisses, snorts, and evasive movements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conservation:<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The IUCN (International Union for  Conservation of Nature) lists the African pygmy hedgehog as 'lower risk-least  concern.&quot; </li>
  <li>Most pet trade hedgehogs come from  captive breeding rather than wild populations.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a></li>
  <li>Importation of the African Hedgehog was  banned in1990, largely because of concerns about introduction of diseases. In  1992 the North American Hedgehog Association (NAHA) was formed by fanciers  dedicated to the health, happiness and successful breeding of African Pygmy  Hedgehogs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpretive Information:<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes called the four-toed hedgehog, it is the  smallest member of the hedgehog family.</li>
  <li>Hedgehogs inhabited the earth even during the time of the  dinosaurs, making the <em>Erinaceidae</em> family the oldest living insectivore.</li>
  <li>A hedgehog will eat the equivalent of  one-third of its body weight in one night. </li>
  <li>The African pygmy hedgehog is covered in tiny, non-barbed  spines. These spines are different from the spines on a porcupine as they are  permanently imbedded in the skin of the animal and are not shed. The movement  of these spines is controlled by the contraction of a muscular 'bag' called the <em>orbicularis panniculi</em>, and the curling behavior is aided by special  morphological adaptations such as having short, blunt ridges on the vertebrae  and a wide pelvis.</li>
  <li>Four-toed hedgehogs&nbsp;are common  exotic pets and are widely bred in captivity.</li>
  <li>Hedgehogs perform a  courtship ritual in which the male walks round and round a female in estrus,  often for hours at a time. After mating, they usually go their own ways.</li>
  <li>Superstitions about this  little animal abound in East Africa. Some people believe that seeds rubbing on  a hedgehog before planting will produce abundant harvests. The skin and spines  are also popular fertility charms.</li>
  <li>Like all hedgehogs, the African pygmy exhibits an  interesting behavior known as self-anointing, sometimes called &ldquo;anting&rdquo;. This  curious behavior usually occurs when the animal encounters an irritating  substance and entails the hedgehog forming a bubbly foam substance in its mouth  and subsequently rubbing the mixture over its spines. One individual was  observed chewing the parotid glands of a toad, and self-anointing with the  toxic mixture (perhaps a defense against predators?). The true reason for  self-anointing is still unknown to scientists, but it has been hypothesized  that it is used to attract attention- males from females, and juveniles from  their mother. Although its specific origin is unknown, scientists know that  this is an innate (instinctual) behavior as it has been observed in juveniles  whose eyes have not yet opened.</li>

    <li>He came from the pet trade.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>They are illegal as pets in Georgia, and he was donated  to the zoo by his previous owner in July, 2011.</li>
