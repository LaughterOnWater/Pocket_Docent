<h2>Beavers in Athens</h2>
<p>Beavers build their own environments by damming creeks to build ponds. The ponds provide shelter and protection from predators.  Beavers are considered a nuisance by some for their tree-gnawing and dam-building methods, but the habitat they create by building dams affords places for many other species to live, increasing local ecological diversity whereever they live. You'll be unlikely to find many beaver homes in Athens. You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Beavers are pure vegetarians (herbivores), subsisting  solely on woody and aquatic vegetation.&nbsp;  They will eat fresh leaves, twigs, stems, and bark. &nbsp;Beavers will chew on any species of tree, but  preferred species include alder, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, poplar and  willow.&nbsp; Aquatic foodstuffs include  cattails, water lilies, sedges and rushes.&nbsp;  Cattail and water lily tubers are favorites.&nbsp; Using their nimble front paws, beavers will  roll lily pads like cigars to eat them.&nbsp;  Beavers do not eat fish or other animals.</li>
    <li>At  Bear Hollow, they eat animal care volunteers cut browse for them and provide  them with other vegetarian options.&nbsp;  Apples are currently a favorite.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Range and  Habitat</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Range" --> <img width="160" height="120" src="../assets/images/north-american-beaver-range-map.gif" align="right" hspace="12" alt="range map: eastern US">
  <ul>
    <li>They  can be found in every continental U.S. State, even in Alaska!<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>Domelike beaver homes, called lodges, are also constructed of  branches and mud. They are often strategically located in the middle of ponds  and can only be reached by underwater entrances. These dwellings are home to  extended families of monogamous parents, young kits, and the yearlings born the  previous spring.<strong><u> </u></strong></li>
    <li>By damming streams, beavers often raise the water level to  surround their lodge with a protective moat, and create the deep water needed  for winter food storage in northern climes.&nbsp;  While other wildlife endure wintertime cold and hunger, beavers stay  warm in their lodges with an underwater food cache of branches nearby.<strong><u> </u></strong></li>
    <li>Beavers prefer to dam streams in shallow valleys, where the  flooded area becomes productive wetlands.&nbsp;  These cradles of life support biodiversity that rivals tropical rain  forests.&nbsp; Almost half of endangered and  threatened species in North America rely upon wetlands.&nbsp; Freshwater wetlands have been related as the  world&rsquo;s most valuable land-based ecosystem.<strong><u> </u></strong></li>
    <li>Fossil records indicate that beaver have lived in North  America for approximately 6 million years.<strong><u> </u></strong></li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>These large rodents move with an ungainly waddle on  land but are graceful in the water, where they use their large, webbed rear  feet like swimming fins, and their paddle-shaped tails like rudders. These  attributes allow beavers to swim at speeds of up to five miles (eight  kilometers) an hour. They can remain underwater for 15 minutes without  surfacing, and have a set of transparent eyelids that function much like  goggles. Their fur is naturally oily and waterproof.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Additionally they have valves (also  referred to as flaps) in their ears and nose that close when swimming in the  murky ponds.</li>
    <li>Most adult beavers weigh in at 20 kilograms but,  with a healthy diet, can get as large as 35 kg. On average they&rsquo;re about 30  centimeters tall and the tail is typically 25 cm long.</li>
    <li>A beaver&rsquo;s tail is a multi-tooled device. While swimming, it  acts as a paddle or rudder. For standing, it props him up so he can see  further. For working, it provides leverage when dragging trees and logs. And  for protection, he slaps the water, making a loud noise to warn family or  intimidate potential predators.</li>
    <li>Beavers are one of the largest rodents on Earth.</li>
    <li>Their front teeth stick out in front of their  lips and behind their incisors they actually have inner lips; both of these  adaptations allow them to cut, chew and carry submerged wood without getting  water in their mouths. And as the teeth never stop growing, chewing on trunks  and branches help the growth.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible">
  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Beavers  live an average of 24 years.</li>
    <li>While  multiple sites have reported beavers living an average of twenty years with no  distinction between living in the wild or captivity, the Minnesota Zoo suggests  that beavers normally only live 10-12 years on average in the wild, and at  least one other source indicates a 10-15 year average lifespan in the wild.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Beavers  mate for life during their third year.&nbsp;  Both parents care for the kits (usually one to four) that are born in  the spring.&nbsp; The youngsters normally stay  with their parents for two years, and the yearlings become babysitters for the  new litter.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>A  beaver colony can consist of six or more, including parents, yearlings and  kits, yet they peacefully coexist in a lodge with underwater access to the  iced-up pond for four months or more in the North.</li>
    <li>Beavers have a  highly organized social structure. Young beaver appear to play and wrestle with  their siblings. This helps to develop their motor skills. They will groom each  other using their hands and teeth. Young beaver have innate abilities to build  dams and lodges, but improve these skills watching their parents or older  siblings.</li>
    <li>Beavers are  typically social and peaceful animals, with a strong family structure. However,  to protect their limited food supply, a beaver will not allow unrelated beavers  to inhabit its pond. To mark their territories they surround their ponds with  scent mounds. Scent mounds are piles of mud with the adult's castor oil mixed  in. They act as warnings to any beaver that may be passing through the area.  Adult beavers will defend their territory by attacking any beaver outside its  family who enters it. However, other than territorial disputes or self-defense,  they appear to have a strong inhibition towards biting and are not known to  attack humans.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>By  the early 1900&rsquo;s, beavers were almost extirpated from North America, Europe,  and Asia due to trapping and the subsequent draining of lands for  agriculture.&nbsp; Estimates of the current  North America population are as low as five percent of those present prior to  European settlement.</li>
    <li><u>Beavers  as an invasive species</u>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In the 1940s, beavers were brought to the island of&nbsp;Tierra Del Fuego&nbsp;in southern Chile and Argentina, for  commercial fur production. However, the project failed and the beavers, a few  pairs, were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment,  they quickly spread throughout the island, and to other islands in the region,  reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. They are now  considered a serious&nbsp;invasive  species&nbsp;in the region, due to  their massive destruction of forest trees, and efforts are being made for their  eradication.&nbsp;The drastically  different ecosystem has led to substantial environmental damage, as the ponds  created by the beavers have no ecological purpose (wetlands do not form there  as they do in the beavers' native territory) and there are no native, large  predators. They have also been found to cross saltwater to islands northward; a  possible encroachment on the mainland has naturalists highly concerned.</li>
      <li>This is similar to the way that Nutria (another large fur  bearing member of the rodent family) have become a problematic invasive animal  in Louisiana after being introduced there for the fur trade. </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Beavers are second only to humans in their ability to  manipulate and change their environment.</li>
    <li>Beavers  are a <u>keystone species</u> and provide significant benefits both to other  animals and to humans.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Benefits of Beaver Ponds for Humans: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Decrease damaging floods</li>
        <li>Recharge drinking water aquifers</li>
        <li>Remove pollutants from surface and ground water</li>
        <li>Drought protection</li>
        <li>Decreased erosion</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Other Benefits:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Produce food for fish and other animals</li>
        <li>Support biodiversity, including 43% of our endangered species &ndash;  This is why beaver ponds are equal to rain forests and coral reefs in the  biodiversity they support! </li>
        <li>Create vital habitats</li>
        <li>Preserve open space</li>
        <li>Maintain stream and  river flow </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>While some beaver behavior is instinctive, they also learn by  imitation and from experience.&nbsp; Dr.  Donald Griffin, the father of animal cognition, has said, &ldquo;When we think of the  kinds of animal behavior that suggest conscious thinking, the beaver comes  naturally to mind.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Tree cutting is part of nature&rsquo;s cycle, and beaver pruning  stimulates willows, cottonwood and aspen to re-grow bushier than ever the next  spring. Beaver chewing and damming kill some tress, but this opens up heavily forested  areas which create important new habitats.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Beavers reliably and economically maintain wetlands that  sponge up floodwaters, alleviate droughts and floods (because their dams keep water  on the land longer), lesson erosion, raise the water table and act as the  &ldquo;earth&rsquo;s kidneys&rdquo; to purify water.&nbsp; The  latter occurs because several feet of silt collect upstream of older beaver  dams, and toxics, such as pesticides, are broken down by microbes in the  wetlands that beavers create.&nbsp; Thus,  water downstream of dams is cleaner and requires less treatment for human use.</li>
    <li><img width="132" height="132" src="../assets/images/north-american-beaver-coin.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="Beaver (cent)">The beaver, along with the maple leaf, is one of the national  emblem&rsquo;s of Canada.&nbsp; The beaver attained  official status as an emblem of Canada when an &quot;act to provide for the  recognition of the beaver (<em>castor canadensis</em>) as a symbol of the sovereignty of Canada&quot; received  royal assent on March 24, 1975. The Beaver played a huge role in the fur  industry that helped build Canada and was also featured on the shield of the  coat of arms of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company.&nbsp; The beaver also appears on Canada&rsquo;s 10 cents coin. </li>
