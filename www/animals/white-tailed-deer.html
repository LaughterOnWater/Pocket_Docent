<h2>White-Tailed Deer in Athens</h2>
<p>Deer are so numerous  around Athens, in our suburbs and farms, that it helps for us to be vigilant while driving, especially at dawn and dusk when lighting can be tricky. You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

    <li>At Bear Hollow, the deer eat a mix  of horse sweet feed, lettuce, carrots and other vegetables.  Strawberries and grapes are a favorite treat.</li>

  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, deer may live to be almost  ten years old, the average being five or six years.</li>
    <li>In captivity, deer can live much longer  – regularly to 14, but occasionally as many as 20 years.</li>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Females enter &lsquo;rut&rsquo; in the late fall and  go through the winter breeding with the dominant male in the area.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>Mature bucks will spar with each other  to determine their place in the hierarchy.   They ram each other and enter pushing matches with their antlers.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>One to three fawns are born to a female  several months later, in May or June.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Deer have numerous scent glands.  They use these to communicate with other deer  in places called rubs (on trees or rocks) and scrapes (in cleared places on the  ground).  </li>
    <li>Considered to be a social animal that  usually travels in small groups.   Generally separated out by the sexes.   Does travel in small units, often with fawns, but bucks either travel  alone or in small bachelor group.</li>
    <li>Deer communicate with various audible  noises including grunts, bleats and snorting.   &nbsp;Additionally, when a white-tail deer is spooked it will raise its tail to warn the  other deer in the area that can see it.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>White tails are a species of little  conservation concern.  They are usually  so numerous that most states have hunting regulations in place for their  harvest.</li>
    <li>A century ago the deer population was  severely depressed for various reasons.   Conservation efforts have since been so successful that, combined with  the lack of natural predators for deer, there are now 30 million deer estimated  to live in the US.  Hunting and  population control methods are necessary to control this species which  threatens farmers&rsquo; crops (being excellent fence jumpers), native fauna (given  that they can decimate plant populations and even destroy attempts at  re-foresting which then drives out other native fauna, even bears, by depriving  them of their food source), as well as human and deer life due to the high  number of vehicular crashes caused by deer.   These concerns actually make deer one of the most dangerous animals in  North America because of the potential damage they can cause by their sheer  numbers.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Fawns are born with light colored spots  all over their body, and no scent.  This  helps them to hide in the leaf litter while their mother is out looking for  food.</li>
    <li>Bucks re-grow their antlers every year.</li>
    <li>Deer are ruminants with a four chambered  stomach.  This allows them to eat a wide  variety of food in a hurry then digest it later.</li>
    <li>They are prey to many animals in the  zoo, including (potentially) the American alligator, the Black Bear, and the  Bobcats.  Bald Eagles and Golden Eagles  can even prey on fawns.  However, their  most effective natural predators are wolves, cougars and American alligators.</li>
