    <li>At Bear Hollow, the turkeys eat various  seeds and grains, as well as scratch food for domestic birds. They also eat any  small animals, insects and acorns they find in their enclosure.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Wild turkeys are found throughout the  entire eastern half of the United States and have a patchy distribution  throughout the western half of the US.</li>
    <li>In  Georgia, wild turkeys can be found statewide, except in the immediate metro  Atlanta area.</li>
    <li>Turkeys require an area that has a mix  of open and covered space. Hardwood forests are a favored habitat, but they can  also be found in meadows, swamps and </li>

    <li>Dark brown to blackish feathers cover  the body.&nbsp; Feathers often have a bronze  or greenish shimmer to them.&nbsp; Head of  both sexes is featherless.</li>
    <li>Long reddish legs.&nbsp; Males develop large pointed spurs on the  backs of their ankles as they age.&nbsp; Wing  feathers are distinctively barred with black and white.</li>
    <li>Males typically weigh between 11 and 24  lbs.&nbsp; Females are slightly smaller,  weighing between 6.5 and 12 lbs.&nbsp;  Wingspans are between four and five feet.</li>

  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, turkeys generally life  three to four years.</li>
    <li>In captivity, they can live as long as  ten to twelve years.</li>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Courtship, and the males&rsquo; extravagant  dancing and calling, begins in March and continues through Spring.</li>
    <li>Females lay ten to fourteen eggs in a  shallow, leaf-lined nest hidden among brush or grass.&nbsp; The poults hatch after about 28 days.</li>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Turkeys are polygamous, with a male  having a group of hens and juveniles with him.</li>
    <li>During the day, turkeys are foraging on  the ground looking for food.&nbsp; At night,  the turkeys fly up into the trees and roost.&nbsp;  This keeps them safe from predation, and they will fly back down to the  ground after the sun has come up.</li>

  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the early 1900&rsquo;s, the entire turkey  population was less than 30,000.&nbsp; Today,  the total population is estimated to be over 7 million birds.</li>
    <li>They are a species of little  conservation concern, and 49 states have turkey hunting seasons.</li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Adult male turkeys are called &lsquo;toms&rsquo;, or  &lsquo;gobblers&rsquo;.&nbsp; Females are &lsquo;hens&rsquo;.&nbsp; Immature males are called &lsquo;jakes&rsquo;, and  juvenile turkeys are known as &lsquo;poults&rsquo;.</li>
    <li>The colors on their heads change with  the turkey&rsquo;s excitement level.</li>
    <li>The various knobs and bumps on a  turkey&rsquo;s head all have names.&nbsp; The  dangling piece over the beak is the snood.&nbsp;  The bumps along the head and face are carnuncles.&nbsp; The fleshy lobes at the base of the neck are  the wattles.</li>
    <li>The Wild Turkey was Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s  choice for our National Bird.</li>
    <li>When  Europeans arrived, they made it one of only two domestic birds native to the  Americas&mdash;the Muscovy duck shares the distinction.</li>
    <li>Wild Turkeys had been hunted nearly to  extinction by the 1900&rsquo;s. Wild  turkey reintroduction programs began in the 1940s, and the birds were relocated  to areas where populations had been decimated but woodlands were recovering.  Such efforts worked so well that wild turkeys now live in areas where they may  not have occurred when Europeans first reached the Americas.</li>
    <li>Domestic  turkeys have white-tipped tails because they are the descendants of a Mexican  subspecies that was taken to Europe for domestication in the early 16th  century. The feature distinguishes them from most modern wild turkeys.</li>
