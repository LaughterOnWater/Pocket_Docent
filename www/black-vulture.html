<h2>Black Vultures in Athens</h2>
<p>They don't normally live this far north, so you're not likely to see them in the wilds of Athens, GA. However they are a native species of southern Georgia. Be sure to visit Okefenokee Swamp to learn more about alligators! You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, the Black Vulture feeds mainly on carrion, although it also scavenges  fish, vegetable material, and dung. Occasionally, Black Vultures attack small  live prey, or in larger groups may attack lambs or newborn pigs. The Black  Vulture relies on others in their group to warn them about approaching danger  while eating; this allows them to eat particularly quickly.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a></li>
    <li>At  Bear Hollow, the Black Vulture eats a rotation of fish, chicks, rats and  prepared carnivore diet though he&rsquo;ll often wait to let some of his food  &ldquo;season&rdquo; before he eats his meals.</li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Range and  Habitat</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Range" --> <img width="232" height="324" src="img/images/black-vulture-range-map.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="range map: eastern US">
  <ul>
    <li>There are two common vulture species &ndash;  the Black Vulture and the Turkey Vulture.&nbsp;  The Black Vulture occurs in more southern areas.</li>
    <li>In Georgia, Black Vultures can be found  statewide.</li>
    <li>The Black Vulture  roosts in dense forests with large trees, and searches open spaces for carrion. </li>
    <li>Black Vultures are more  common in flat lowlands than in higher elevations. They often soar higher than  Turkey Vultures and gather in large numbers at roadkill and other carrion. </li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Black body with grey, featherless head.</li>
    <li>Wings also are tipped with white on the  underside.</li>
    <li>They have a short hooked beak.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, turkeys generally life  three to four years.</li>
    <li>In captivity, they can live as long as  ten to twelve years.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of building a  nest, the Black Vulture lays its eggs (normally two) on the bare ground of the  chosen nest site. Parents incubate the young equally. </li>
    <li>The Black Vulture lays  its eggs in isolated locations with little human disturbance. They find a dark  recess in a cave, abandoned building, thicket, pile of rocks, or in a hollow  log or tree. A pair of Black Vultures may assure themselves of the site&rsquo;s  isolation by perching nearby for a period of weeks before egg-laying.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>The Black Vulture is  monogamous and forms strong social bonds to its kin.&nbsp; They are believed to mate for life.</li>
    <li>The Black Vulture soars  on thermals to gain altitude and to cover large distances with little energy  expenditure. Black Vultures have a less well-developed sense of smell than  Turkey Vultures and rely more on sight than smell to find carrion. </li>
    <li>One-on-one, a Black  Vulture can be dominated by the slightly larger Turkey Vulture. But, Black  Vultures rarely travel alone. Flocks of Black Vultures can quickly take over a  carcass and drive the more solitary Turkey Vultures away.</li>
  </ul>

  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>They are a species of little  conservation concern.</li>
    <li>This is the most  abundant vulture in the Western Hemisphere, and populations seem to be steady  or rising in North America. Black Vultures benefit from human garbage at  landfills and dumpsters, but they are also sometimes trapped, shot, and  poisoned.</li>
    <li>As migratory birds,  they are completely protected by federal law. </li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Vultures have a very unique defense  system.&nbsp; When threatened they will  actually induce vomiting and throw up on or near an approaching predator.&nbsp; Because their diet is carrion, the stench is  overwhelming, but the stench is not the only part of the defense.&nbsp; Their stomach acids are extremely strong,  which allows them to remain healthy even after eating a sick animal because the  acid is so powerful that it breaks down pathogens before they can infect the  vulture.&nbsp; This strong acid, in addition  to keeping the vultures healthy, can also keep the vultures safe by literally  burning attackers.&nbsp; Vomiting also makes the vulture lighter,  making it easier for a glutted vulture to fly away to safety.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>These strong stomach acids make Vultures  extremely valuable to our environment.&nbsp;  They can safely digest and get rid of almost all harmful bacteria and pathogens  that might infect humans or other animals.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>Black vultures do not have feathers on  their heads in order to protect themselves from the pathogens that they might  come in contact with when eating carrion.&nbsp;  A bald head makes clean up a lot easier and helps keeps the birds safe  and sanitary.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>Vomiting is also how they feed their  young as they do not carry food back to their young with their beaks or feet.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>Vultures legs are grey but often appear  white because they squirt urine and excrement onto their own legs which dries  white.&nbsp; They do this to help keep  themselves cool.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
