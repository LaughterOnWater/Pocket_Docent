<h2>Bog Turtles in Athens</h2>
<p>Bog Turtles only live in the very northeast tip of Georgia. They are not found around Athens in the wild. They are an endangered species. You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, bog turtles feed  opportunistically on a wide variety of prey including insects, earthworms,  snails, slugs, crayfish, millipedes, frogs, tadpoles, salamanders, watersnakes,  and the young of mice, but also eat an array of aquatic vegetation, seeds, and  berries, and occasionally scavenge on carrion.</li>
    <li>At Bear Hollow, the bog turtle eats aquatic  turtle pellets or small pieces of fish (like smelt).</li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Range and  Habitat</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Range" --> <img width="188" height="269" src="assets/images/bog-turtle-range-map.gif" align="right" hspace="12" alt="range map: eastern US">
  <ul>
    <li>Georgia  bogs inhabited by this elusive turtle are generally found along slowly flowing  spring creeks and seepages within low mountain valleys. Habitats capable of  supporting a viable bog turtle population may be as small as an acre. Though  the habitat type of this turtle varies from spring seepages, bogs, and wet  meadows, the presence of soft, deep, mucky organic soil and open wet areas with  shallow water are prerequisites to inhabitation by bog turtles.</li>
    <li>Bog turtles have a discontinuous range  that stretches from western Massachusetts southward to extreme northeastern  Georgia. A large gap in West Virginia and northern Virginia separates the  so-called northern and southern populations. Disjunct populations are known  from upper New York, northwestern Pennsylvania, and northeastern Tennessee. </li>
    <li>The existence of this species in Georgia  was unknown until 1979, when an individual was captured in a trap set for  ruffed grouse. Bog turtles reach their southernmost limit in northern Georgia  and were probably never very abundant there.</li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>The bog turtle is the smallest turtle  species in North America reaching only 11.5 cm (4&frac12; inches) in maximum carapace  length.</li>
    <li>A conspicuous orange, yellow, or red  blotch is present on each side of the head behind the eye. Skin color is brown  to pink and may have some reddish mottling.</li>
    <li>Within the range of the bog turtle in  Georgia, only the common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus) remotely resembles  the appearance of the bog turtle. However, this turtle lacks the bog turtle&rsquo;s  neck blotch and its plastron is weakly hinged.</li>
    <li>The bog  turtle is&nbsp;semi-aquatic&nbsp;and can move  both on land and in the water. </li>

  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>We were  unable to find specific data on  the lifespan of these turtles in captivity or in the wild.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Male turtles roam widely in search of  females shortly after they become active in late March. Courtship and breeding  occur from late April to early June, and eggs are subsequently laid from May to  July. </li>
    <li>Eggs are either buried in soft soil or  rotted wood, placed in thick beds of sphagnum moss, or deposited in the top of  sedge tussocks. These nest sites are usually located in areas receiving  plentiful sunlight. </li>
    <li>Adult females produce only one clutch of  one to six elliptical eggs per year, but may not nest every year. In Georgia,  incubation time varies from 52 to 60 days with hatchlings typically emerging in  late August or September and immediately burrowing into the surrounding  substrate. </li>
    <li>Bog turtles in the wild reach sexual  maturity at the age of 7-9 years.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Bog turtles are primarily active during  spring, early summer, and early fall. Turtles may become relatively inactive if  the summer months are extremely hot and dry.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Protected  under the United States Federal Endangered Species Act,&nbsp;the bog turtle is considered&nbsp;threatened&nbsp;in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New  Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania as of November 4, 1997. Due to a  &quot;similarity of appearance&quot; to the northern population, the bog turtle  is also threatened in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and  Virginia (considered to be the southern population).&nbsp;In addition to the federal listing of  threatened, states in the southern range list the bog turtle as either  endangered or threatened.</li>
    <li>The high demand for bog turtles in the  black market pet trade has resulted in the removal of many individuals from  sites in other states and may be a threat in Georgia as well.</li>
    <li>Range-wide, bog turtles have experienced  their greatest decline in numbers due to loss of habitat. Alteration of habitat  disturbance regimes and agricultural drainage of bog habitat often leads to the  extirpation of the bog turtle through the elimination of suitable basking,  foraging, and nesting sites.</li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>While they are not federally protected,  they are considered &ldquo;Rare&rdquo; in Georgia and various protected populations exist.</li>

    <li>Sex is unknown. It arrived in July of  2012.&nbsp; Currently unnamed.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
    <li>The only thing we can say for sure about  it is that it was almost definitely someone&rsquo;s pet before it came to  us.&nbsp; It appears quite imprinted on or  at least very interested in humans.&nbsp; It  is very personable and will almost always come up to greet visitors at the  front of the aquarium!</li>
