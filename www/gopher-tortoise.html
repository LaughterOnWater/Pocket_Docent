<h2>Gopher Tortoises in Athens</h2>
<p>Gopher Tortoises live in the southern part of Georgia in its Longleaf Pine Savannas, so you're not likely to see them in the wilds of Athens, GA. However they are a native species of southern Georgia. There are a number of conservation efforts set to help these tortoises thrive. You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, gopher tortoises eat a  variety of vegetation.&nbsp; Mostly wiregrass,  but also other grasses, forbs (an herb that is not like a grass), and small  herbaceous plants.&nbsp; Cacti are also  favored.</li>
    <li>At  Bear Hollow, the tortoises eat a mix of prepared tortoise pellets, leafy greens  and occasionally some fruit. </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Range" --> <img width="272" height="220" src="img/images/gopher-tortoise-range-map.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="range map: eastern US">
  <ul>
    <li>Gopher tortoises live in South Carolina,  Georgia, Florida, Alabama and into Mississippi.</li>
    <li>In Georgia, the tortoises are found in  the southern half of the state, in the coastal plain.&nbsp; They seem to be absent from the Okefenokee  Swamp.</li>
    <li>Gophers are a resident in the sandhills,  particularly of the longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem.</li>
    <li>They need open areas with sandy soil and  lots of grasses and other vegetation to forage.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Usually some shade of grayish  brown.&nbsp; Very tough scales covering legs,  soft dry skin on neck and inner legs.</li>
    <li>Wide round head.&nbsp; Stump-like back feet; front legs are flat,  and shovel-like.&nbsp; Very short, stubby  tail.&nbsp; Domed shell is usually between  nine and eleven inches long.</li>
    <li>Males tend to be a little larger than  females and have a concave plastron.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible">
  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Adults, particularly females, may not  reach reproductive maturity until they are nearly 20 years old.&nbsp; In the wild, they can live from forty - sixty  years; in captivity, for seventy years.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Mating occurs in April through  June.&nbsp; Males court females by chasing  them around feeding territories.</li>
    <li>Nesting is in June, with the peak being  towards the middle of the month.</li>
    <li>An average of six round eggs are laid in  the apron of the burrow and will incubate for about 100 days.</li>
    <li>The babies hatch out and are on their  own from then on.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Gopher tortoises are fairly social  animals.&nbsp; They live in colonies and are  often found out foraging for food near each other.</li>
    <li>They may create &lsquo;highways&rsquo; or  well-traveled, easily seen footpaths to favored feeding grounds or between  individual burrows.</li>
    <li>Adult males will sometimes skirmish with  each other and get into pushing matches, particularly as they get into breeding  season.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Gophers used to be rather common  turtles.&nbsp; It is estimated that over the  last century, their population numbers have been decreased by eighty percent.</li>
    <li>They are now listed as a Threatened  species, at both the state of Georgia and federal levels and are completely  protected.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;When fire is suppressed in gopher tortoise  habitat, small trees, shrubs, and brambles begin to grow making it difficult  for the gopher tortoise to move around and eventually shade out the low growing  plants that gopher tortoises eat.</li>
    <li>Along with the suppression of natural  forest fires and loss of habitat, gophers are being hit hard by another  problem: upper respiratory tract disease.</li>
    <li>They graze on vegetation  just like cows, and therefore, are important players in spreading seeds. </li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>The sex of baby gophers is determined by  temperatures while the eggs are incubating.&nbsp;  If the temperature is at 84 degrees, or a little lower, the babies are  male.&nbsp; If the temperature is at 86 or a  little higher, the babies come out female.&nbsp;  Right around 85 degrees produces a mix of males and females.</li>
    <li>The entrance to the burrow is called the  apron.&nbsp; It is made by the gophers  flinging sand out as they burrow, and it creates a rounded, wide-open, sandy  area just in front of the actual burrow hole.</li>
    <li>Burrows can be up to forty feet in  length and six to ten feet underground. &nbsp;They are known to house over 350 species of  other animals (from foxes to camel crickets!).&nbsp;  Because of this, gophers are known as a keystone species of the longleaf  pine community.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Unfortunately, many tortoises in the  past were killed by food or by rattlesnake hunters. The introduction of  gasoline into the burrows of gopher tortoises (&ldquo;gassing&rdquo;) is a technique used  by some rattlesnake hunters to force the snakes to the surface. This practice  is typically fatal to all burrow inhabitants.</li>
    <li>GA&rsquo;s State Reptile</li>
    <li>Gopher tortoises are ancient:&nbsp; their ancestors are a species of land  tortoise that originated in western North America some 60 million years  ago.&nbsp; They are the only tortoise that  occurs east of the Mississippi River, in habitats that some refer to as the  &ldquo;southeastern desert.&rdquo;</li>
