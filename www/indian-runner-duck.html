<h3><img width="311" height="145" src="img/images/indian-runner-duck-range-map.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="NorwegianRat_rangeMap.png">Range and  Habitat:<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Indian Runner Ducks are originally from  the S.E. Asia &amp; Indonesia.</li>
  <li>They can currently be found worldwide on  farms, ponds, and lakes, pretty much anywhere but Antarctica.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Physical Features:<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>They have very long neck and stand  upright. The feet are pushed much further back on the body than most ducks.  Since the feet are pushed farther back and ducks walk upright, they do not  waddle or fly. In size they can range from 12 inches up to 14 inches and can  weigh around 3 to 5 pounds. These birds are bred in many colors including  white, black, gray, chocolate, fawn, tan, and blue. </li>
  <li>Unlike other ducks, the Indian Runner  does not waddle but rather the position of its legs gives them a characteristic  running motion.&nbsp; They also have long  snake-like necks, and when wandering around they walk flat but stand upright  when disturbed.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Life Span:<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>In captivity these ducks can live from 8  to 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reproduction:<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The clutch size of the Indian Runner  Duck can range from 8-14 eggs.</li>
  <li>These ducks do not need water for  breeding.</li>
  <li>The incubation of the eggs takes  approximately 28 days.</li>
  <li>The eggs are white, off-white, blue, or  light green. They are the size of a chicken egg.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Behavior:<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>With this breed of duck the females are  more talkative than their male counterparts. </li>
  <li>They are typically very friendly toward  people and other ducks and can be easily held by people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conservation:<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Indian Runner Duck is considered  &ldquo;watched&rdquo; status by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy with fewer than  5,000 breeding birds in North America and 10 or fewer breeding flocks.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpretive Information:<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><u> </u></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Nicknamed the &ldquo;bowling pin duck,&rdquo; the  Indian Runner Duck does not fly or waddle. As its name suggests it is a very  good runner.</li>
  <li>They are known for being excellent egg  layers, laying up to 180 per year.</li>
  <li>They are a favorite among poultry  lovers. They are bred for natural pest control. Their waste makes good  fertilizer and they are often kept as pets. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>The Indian Runner Duck breed is believed  to have originated in Southeast Asia. They are most likely from the islands of  Indonesia, an area once known as the Dutch Indies, hence the name. In the 1800s  a ship&rsquo;s captain took two of these ducks from Malaya back to his home in Scotland.  There the ducks were bred and the offspring distributed across the border into  England.</li>
  <li>Runners have a long  history as evidenced by ancient Javan temple carvings indicating that  Runner-type ducks existed in Indo China 2000 years ago.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a></li>
  <li>Indian  Runner Ducks are considered a very special breed of domestic duck. When they  were first imported into Europe in the 1800&rsquo;s, they attracted attention because  of their tall, upright bodies and their incredible reputation for egg-laying.  They had been found in the East Indies, from which they get their present name,  but were referred to as &ldquo;Penguin Ducks&rdquo; by Dutch explorers and some of the  early importers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bear Hollow&rsquo;s Indian Runner Duck:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Male:&nbsp;  Dexter: (pictured above) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>He was most likely born around May of  2011. </li>
    <li>Zoo staff became aware of Dexter when a  visitor informed staff that there was a duck having trouble out in the pond in  Memorial Park.&nbsp; While park staff do not  feed, treat or manage wild animal populations on the lake, they will check out  reports of animals in distress.&nbsp; When  they arrived they found that sure enough, Dexter was water-logged, basically  half-drowned and was being bullied by the wild geese and ducks, who, as a  survival instinct, attempted to drive him away because he was weak and would  attract predators.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Staff observed that Dexter&rsquo;s wings were  deformed due to malnutrition and surmised that someone got him for Easter in  2011, didn&rsquo;t know how to take care of him properly, and then abandoned him at  Memorial Park, thinking that he would be fine there, without realizing that he  is not truly a water duck. </li>
    <li>Dexter was clearly imprinted on humans  and is not afraid of humans at all, so staff rescued him and he&rsquo;s been at the  zoo since Spring of 2012. </li>
