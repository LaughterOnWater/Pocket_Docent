<h3>Diet:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In urban environments they eat mainly  discarded human food </li>
  <li>Near the sea they have been observed  catching fish</li>
  <li>They will also eat chicks, mice, birds,  &amp; small lizards</li>
  <li>At Bear  Hollow, the Rats eat commercially prepared rodent diet, various nuts and seeds,  and fresh fruits and vegetables.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Range and Habitat:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Can  be found on every continent of the world except Antarctica</li>
  <li>Before they spread across the globe they  were found only in Asia where they live primarily in forests and brushy areas</li>
  <li>Today they can be found living in a  variety of habitats, such as dumps, sewers, open fields &amp; woodlands, &amp;  basements. Basically where ever there are people </li>
  <li>Their average home range or territories  is 164 feet</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physical Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Covered with coarse, brownish fur (sometimes splotched  with black or white hairs) on their dorsal surface, which usually lightens to a  gray or tan color nearing the underside. Various strains of these rats bred in  captivity may be white, brown, or black.</li>
  <li>The ears and tail are bald<strong><u> </u></strong></li>
  <li>Avg. length is 16 inches. Avg. weight is  almost a pound.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Life Span:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Up to 2 years in the wild, and up to 4  years in captivity</li>
  <li><a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Rattus_norvegicus.html"><em>Rattus norvegicus</em></a>&nbsp;is preyed on by any number of carnivorous mammals, birds, and  reptiles. Humans also kill very large numbers of Norway rats as pests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reproduction:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The mating system of&nbsp;<a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Rattus_norvegicus.html"><em>R. norvegicus</em></a>&nbsp;is best described as Polygynandrous. Social animals, Norway  rats tend to breed in large groups. </li>
  <li>Although not technically a seasonal breeder, a mating  increase occurs in the warmer months of the year. An average female is capable  of giving birth approximately 8 pups, about seven times per year. Each litter  has a short gestation period of 22 to 24 days. The young are very small and  underdeveloped. It takes 14 to 17 days for the young's eyes to open. They are  weaned at 3 to 4 weeks, and the young then leave the nest.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Males usually reach sexual maturity at 3 months and females  at 4. <strong><u> </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Behavior:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Often, the litters of numerous females will occupy the same  nest, and all the young are cared for by the adults, regardless of who the true  mothers are. This communal care makes the species something of a cooperative  breeder.</li>
  <li>Live in large nests or burrows with many  others</li>
  <li>They are vocal, and use visual cues such  as body posture when communicating</li>
  <li>The hierarchy of these groups is based  on size</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conservation:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These animals are not a conservation concern. In fact, humans  spend a great deal of effort trying to eradicate them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpretive Information:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Norway rats are excellent competitors and will readily drive  out competing rat species, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Rattus_rattus.html"><em>Rattus rattus</em></a>. Because of their foraging  habits, Norway rats act as seed dispersers. Their burrows also tend to aerate  the soil. As prey, they help to sustain predator populations. Norway rats are communal  species with humans.</li>
  <li>They are able to sense very minute vibrations in the ground,  and feel their way through total darkness with their paws and whiskers. </li>
  <li>First introduced into the United States around 1775, the  Norway rat has now spread throughout the contiguous 48 states.</li>
  <li>Examination  of a wild&nbsp;<a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Rattus_norvegicus.html"><em>R. norvegicus</em></a>&nbsp;stomach in Germany revealed 4000 items, most  of which were plants, although studies have shown that Norway rats prefer meat  when given the option.</li>
  <li>Rats are very clean animals, they spend several hours per day  grooming themselves.</li>
  <li>They can chew through metals such as copper and aluminum.</li>
  <li>They have an excellent memory. Once they learn a path they  will never forget it.</li>
</ul>
