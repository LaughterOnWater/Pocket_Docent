<h3><img src="assets/images/red-tailed-hawk-range-map.jpg" alt="Red-tailed Hawk Range Map" width="217" height="303" hspace="12" align="right">Range and  Habitat</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Red tailed hawks live throughout North  America.&nbsp; They favor interrupted  landscapes &ndash; areas that have a mix of trees, open areas and water.</li>
  <li>They do not like thick forests, nor are  they found in extremely cold places. </li>
  <li>In Georgia, they can be found throughout  the entire state in all of the different habitats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Physical Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Length of the body is between 18 and 26  inches.&nbsp; Red tailed hawks typically weigh  about two to three and a half pounds.&nbsp;  Females tend to be a bit larger than the males.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Wingspan is just shy of five feet.</li>
  <li>The body is brownish on top, with a  lighter colored belly.&nbsp; Usually darker  spots and speckling and a band across the chest are present.</li>
  <li>The tail is a smooth brick red  color.&nbsp; The legs and feet are bright  yellow.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Life Span</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Red tailed hawks can live anywhere from  10 to 21 years.&nbsp; There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be  much difference in the wild or in captivity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reproduction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The nest is big and bulky being composed  of sticks and dried plant material.&nbsp;  Often it is lined with bark fibers, pine needles or corn husks.</li>
  <li>One to three eggs are laid in March or  April.&nbsp; The young hatch after about 30  days and are ready to leave the nest approximately 45 days after hatching. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Behavior</h3>

  <li>Red tails are monogamous and will stay  with the same mate for life.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conservation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A species of little conservation  concern; however, they are completely protected by both state and federal laws  as birds of prey.</li>
  <li>Very numerous and commonly seen.&nbsp; Population estimates place them at over 1  million birds in the United States alone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpretive Information</h3>

  <li>Generally shy birds that tend to fly rather  than defend themselves or their nest.</li>
  <li>Its high piercing scream is the one that  is used in movies to portray eagles and, to a lesser extent, vultures.</li>
