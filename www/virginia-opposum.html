<h2>Opossums in Athens</h2>
<p>You've probably seen or heard Virginia Opossums at night. They are excellent scavengers and often live near humans to take advantage of our leavings, for instance outdoor pet food bowls. You can learn more than the casual observer by clicking the buttons below...</p>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Diet</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Diet" -->
  <ul>
    <li>In the wild, opossums are omnivorous and  will eat anything. Carrion and persimmons are favorites. Insects, other fruits  and vegetables, pet food and garbage are also consumed.</li>
    <li>In captivity, their main diet is  composed of a mix of dry cat food, bananas, strawberries and yogurt. Nearly  anything can be offered in addition.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>

<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Range and  Habitat</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Range" --> <img width="291" height="170" src="assets/images/virginia-opposum-range-map.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="range map: eastern US">
  <ul>
    <li>Originally native to the eastern  United States, opossums are now found all throughout the West and up into  Canada.</li>
    <li>In Georgia, they occur statewide.</li>
    <li>Opossums are cosmopolitan, and can be  found in every type of habitat. From forested areas, to mountains, in swamps,  and along costal waterways, as well urban areas.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Physical Features</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Features" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Opossums have a long snout on a big  round head, with white fur on the face.</li>
    <li>Ears are black at the base, and pink or  white at the tips.</li>
    <li>The body is covered in thick, but soft,  gray fur. Long silver guard hairs cover the undercoat.</li>
    <li>The tail is long and hairless. Overall,  opossums are reminiscent of oversized rats.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
  <h2>Life Span</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="LifeSpan" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Considerably shorter than comparably  sized small mammals. Opossums generally do not live longer than 2 to 4 years.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Reproduction</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Reproduction" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Can occur anytime of the year, most  commonly in the spring.</li>
    <li>Up to 15 young are born in a very  premature state, and must crawl blindly into the pouch where they attach to a  teat. At this size, they are around the size of a bean.</li>
    <li>After growing inside the pouch for  several weeks, as the young age, they begin to ride piggy-back on their  mothers&rsquo; fur. They are weaned at about 4 months of age.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Social Behavior</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Social" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Opossums are normally solitary  creatures.</li>
    <li>Active predominantly at night, but may  be seen moving around during dusk and dawn.</li>
    <li>Females may be found with young until  they are weaned; even then some young may follow their mother for a period  afterward.</li>
    <li>Nomadic in nature, opossums wander  throughout their home ranges foraging for food.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
  <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Conservation</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Conservation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>A species of little conservation  concern. Opossums are incredibly common, almost to the point of being  considered nuisance animals in some locations.</li>
    <li>Formerly used as a source of meat of  human consumption, but this practice has fallen out of favor.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
<div data-role="collapsible"><h2>&nbsp;Interpretive Information</h2>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Interpretation" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Opossums have a remarkable immune  system. They are at least partially, if not completely, immune to venom from  snakebite.</li>
    <li>Not very likely to carry rabies. As few  as 1 in 800 opossums are affected by this disease.</li>
    <li>Opossums have the most teeth of any  animal in North America &ndash; 52 teeth are in that tiny mouth.</li>

    <li>Two new oppossums - male and female - born  Summer 2014 to be named shortly. Abandoned by mother - found and rescued.</li>
<li>Past Opossums</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Daisy Mae came to the zoo in Spring 2011  in a litter of eight.&nbsp; Her siblings were  released, but she was raised by hand by Lyndsey to be a program animal.&nbsp; Lyndsey had to carry her everywhere in her  purse so she&rsquo;s very used to being handled. </li>
      <li>Pogo is the opossum pictured above.&nbsp; He was on display prior to Daisy Mae and our  current two.<strong><u></u></strong></li>
